  <h2>The USC Shoah Foundation</h2>
  <p>
    <h3> The whole point of the Shoah Foundation is to teach about past genocides and to remember the stories of those who lived through them. Each year a select few are allowed to embark on this<br /><br /> learning expierence.
      I was given the opportunity to do this twice (once before Covid and once during). Each time I did it I learned more about the past, and I was able to have a deeper<br /><br /> understanding of the genocides that were talked about.
      One of my favorite things about this expierence was being able to go to a mueseum that outlined the Japanese-American expierence<br /><br /> during World War II. The USC Shoah Foundation was eye opening and quite enjoyable.
