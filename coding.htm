      <li>Middle School: I took a course in middle school that was almost an introduction to coding. It was a simple but fun class!</li>
    <br />  <li>Intro to Web Design and Development: In Ninth-grade I took intro to web design and dev. It was a challenging and fun class. This class tought me more about coding and actually allowed me to develope a few websites.</li>
      <br /><li>AP Computer Science Principles: In future years I might want to take AP Com. Sci. Principles because it seems like a fun class. And Challenging as well!</li>
