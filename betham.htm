  <h2>Oh When the Jews Go Wash Their Hands</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Camp Ramah: I have gone to Camp Ramah many times in my life. Being at a Jewish camp allows me to express my Judaism while meeting and creating new friends!</li>
    <br />  <li>USY: I have gone to many USY events. Each and everyone of the events is new and exciting. Going to these events allow for me to connect to my peers!</li>
      <br /><li>Reading Torah: I have read from the Torah many times, each time I do it's like looking into the past!</li>
      <br /><li>Keeping Kosher: Keeping Kosher is very interesting. It makes sure I watch what I eat (at least when it comes to being more aware of what I am eating)!</li>
