  <h2>There's No Crying in Sports</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Gymnastics: I did gymnastics for a few years when I was around three to five. I don't have many memories from this sport.</li>
    <br />  <li>Soccer: Playing this sport was not one of my more memorable experiences. To say the very least I was not very good.</li>
      <br /><li>Baseball: Being a short-stop, Second-Baseman, and outfielder has allowed me to be quick on my toes. I played baseball for a few years and I still enjoy the sport to this day!</li>
      <br /><li>Football: I played QuarterBack, Wide Reciever, and Safety. Again this sport has allowed for me to be quick on my toes. And just like Baseball I still love this sport!</li>
      <br /><li>Track and Field: I am a competer in the 100 meter race and the 110 meter Hurdles. Though I am not the greatest I have improved tremendously!</li>
