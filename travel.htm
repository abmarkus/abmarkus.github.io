  <h2>Oh the Places I have Gone</h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Washington D.C.: I went to the capitol of the USA when I was five years old. The best part of this trip was being outside while it was lightly snowing!</li>
    <br />  <li>Pennsylvania: I went to Pennsylvania when I was around seven years old. The best part of this trip was going up the stair Rocky did in the movie with the same name!</li>
      <br /><li>New York: I have been to New York twice in my lifetime. The best part of being there was the energy!</li>
      <br /><li>Canada: I went to Canada around the age of seven. The best part was the food!</li>
      <br /><li>Israel: I went to Israel when I was around 10 years old. The best part was climbing Masada and floating in the Dead Sea (as well as the food)!</li>
      <br /><li>England: I have been to England twice and both times the best part was the food and the scenery (and seeing Shakespear's plays)!</li>
      <br /><li>Scotland: I went to Scotland when I was 15. The best part of this trip, without a doubt it my mind, was the scenery. The mountains were amazing and the amount of sheep were bewildering!</li>
    </ul>
