      <br /><br />  <img src="images/selfpic2.gif"  alt="selfie" class="selfie" width="305" height="331">
         I was born in San Diego in 2006. I have lived in San Diego for all my life, and I
have gone to the same school (SDJA) since I was
around five years old. I have played many sports in my life, playing
 sports has always been a big
 part of who I am. Every sport I played has meant something different to me. Wether it be comradery or some plain old fun, it means something to me.
Other than sports, my Jewish identity has been a big part of my life. When I was 15 I was
on the USY board of my
Synagogue (Beth Am). I have also gone to Camp for a number of years.
I have always been eager
to participate in activities
from my school,
Synagogue, or anything else that I have interests in.
