  <h2>The Far West Beth Am USY Board</h2>

  <p>
    <h3>I have been on the board for one year as of 2022. For the past year I was the Special Events and Fundraising Co-Chair on the general board. My job was mainly to focus on planning special<br /><br /> events and work on trying to get some fundraising.
    Sadly, I was unable to do much that year due to Covid. So, the following year, I am going to be on the general board. Being able to focus <br /><br /> on membership / younger kids will allow me to reach my ultimate goal.
  As well as to work on my creative skills.</h3><br /><br />
