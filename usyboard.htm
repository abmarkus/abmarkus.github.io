  <h2>The Far West Beth Am USY Board</h2>

  <p>
    <h3>I have been on the board for one year as of 2022. For the past year I was the Special Events and Fundraising Co-Chair on the general board. My job was mainly to focus on planning special<br /><br /> events and work on trying to get some fundraising.
    Sadly, I was unable to do much that year due to Covid. So, the following year, I applyed to be either the Membership / Kadima Vice<br /><br /> President or Social Action / Tikkun Olam Vice President. Taking either of these roles would be an even greater achievment because it would mean that I would be on the Executive Board.<br /><br />
     Being on the USY board has allowed me to grow my leadership
    and to work on my creative skills.</h3><br /><br />
