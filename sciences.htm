      <li>Biology: In my ninth grade class we have been studying Biology. We have learned more in depth about cells and how life comes to be!</li>
    <br />  <li>Grade Sciences:Before ninth grade the class would go over small parts of each topic. The classes weren't as focused on one topic!</li>
      <br /><li>Chemistry: I want to learn Chemistry in future years. I want to learn how much of something I need to make something else!</li>
